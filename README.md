## Genshin Text for Notepad++
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46252567/211456041-2d9bcdd0-d344-40a8-b64f-07f2344897e5.png)
Comments work in a few different syntax

I just made this because I usually use regular notepad
and got tired of flashbanging my eyes
<br>(If you dont want to flashbang your eyes: Settings -> Preferences -> Dark Mode -> Enable Dark Mode)

On the menu bar: Language -> User Defined Languaged -> Define your language... -> Import...
Select the xml file

To use on a file:
- open it in notepad++
- Language -> Genshin

When new characters are added, simply go to Language -> User Defined Languaged -> Define your language...
and add them to the correct Keywords List on the Keywords tab
feel free to customize the colour using the styler or add new keywords
